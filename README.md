## Credits
- Any online resources for figuring out code will be linked in the relevant scripts and listed here when the project is further along
- While ideally I would love to have custom models and animations for everything. Thinking realisitcally for now the models and animations will be sourced from the likes of Sketchfab, Mixamo. But certain objects I may need can still be modelled by hand. All references will be placed here when the project is further along too
